   **   ~~~   ** ..Location object=TURIN
   **   ~~~   ** ..Weather File Location=San Francisco Intl Ap CA USA TMY3 WMO#=724940
   **   ~~~   ** ..due to location differences, Latitude difference=[7.60] degrees, Longitude difference=[130.05] degrees.

   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: Window dimensions differ from Window 5/6 data file dimensions, 2 times.
   **   ~~~   ** This will affect the frame heat transfer calculation if the frame in the Data File entry
   **   ~~~   ** is not uniform, i.e., has sections with different geometry and/or thermal properties.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each window, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 2 nominally unused constructions in input.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each unused construction, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;

   ** Severe  ** GetInternalHeatGains: Errors with invalid names in OtherEquipment objects.
   **   ~~~   ** ...These will not be read in.  Other errors may occur.

   ..... Last severe error=GetInternalHeatGains: Errors with invalid names in OtherEquipment objects.
   ************* Warning:  Node connection errors not checked - most system input has not been read (see previous warning).
   ************* Fatal error -- final processing.  Program exited before simulations began.  See previous error messages.

   ************* ===== Final Error Summary =====
   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* Nominally Unused Constructions
   ************* ..The nominally unused constructions warning is provided to alert you to potential conditions that can cause
   ************* ..extra time during simulation. Each construction is calculated by the algorithm indicated in the HeatBalanceAlgorithm
   ************* ..object. You may remove the constructions indicated (when you use the DisplayExtraWarnings option).
