   ** Warning ** CheckEnvironmentSpecifications: SimulationControl specified doing design day simulations, but no design environments specified.
   **   ~~~   ** ...No design environment results produced. For these results, add appropriate SizingPeriod:* objects for your simulation.
   ** Warning ** Weather file location will be used rather than entered (IDF) Location object.
   **   ~~~   ** ..Location object=FDSFDAF
   **   ~~~   ** ..Weather File Location=TORINO - ITA IWEC Data WMO#=160590
   **   ~~~   ** ..due to location differences, Latitude difference=[0.00] degrees, Longitude difference=[0.00] degrees.
   **   ~~~   ** ..Time Zone difference=[12.0] hour(s), Elevation difference=[0.00] percent, [0.00] meters.
   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: Window dimensions differ from Window 5/6 data file dimensions, 1 times.
   **   ~~~   ** This will affect the frame heat transfer calculation if the frame in the Data File entry
   **   ~~~   ** is not uniform, i.e., has sections with different geometry and/or thermal properties.
